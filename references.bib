  abstract  = "The delay overhead of transaction verification in Bitcoin, a
               peer-to-peer electronic currency system, is a complicated issue
               which makes the system vulnerable to double spend attacks. In
               this paper, we propose a new approach, that is based on how the
               clusters are formulated and the nodes define their membership,
               to improve the transaction propagation delay in the Bitcoin
               network. In this approach, the locality of connectivity in the
               Bitcoin network is increased by grouping Bitcoin nodes based on
               their geographical location. We show, through simulations, that
               location based-distance better defines clustering structures
               that optimize the performance of the transaction propagation
               delay. A key reason behind this improvement is mainly due to the
               reduction of the communication link cost measured by the
               distance between nodes. Compared to the existing clustering
               protocol (BCBSN) that we proposed in our previous work, location
               based clustering is more effective at reducing the transaction
               propagation delay.",

  abstract  = "ABSTRACTOver recent years, interest has been growing in Bitcoin,
               an innovation that has the potential to play an important role
               in e-commerce and beyond. The aim of our paper is to provide a
               comprehensive empirical study of the payment and investment
               features of Bitcoin, and their implications for the conduct of
               e-commerce. Since network externality theory suggests that the
               value of a network and its take-up are interlinked, we
               investigate both adoption and price formation. We discover that
               its returns are driven primarily by Bitcoin?s popularity, the
               sentiment expressed in newspaper reports on cryptocurrency, and
               total number of transactions. The paper also reports on the
               first global survey of merchants who have adopted this
               technology, and we model the share of sales paid for with this
               alternative currency, using both ordinary and Tobit regressions.
               Our analysis examines how country-, customer-, and
               company-specific characteristics interact with the proportion of
               sales attributed to Bitcoin. We find that company features, use
               of other payment methods, customers? knowledge about Bitcoin,
               and the size of both the official and unofficial economy are
               significant determinants. The results will be of interest to
               traders who seek to understand factors driving prices and will
               help to inform vendors as to the most favorable circumstances
               for adopting the currency for online transactions.",

               activity at the leading Mt. Gox exchange between April 2011 and
               November 2013. We find that following DDoS attacks on Mt. Gox,
               the number of large trades on the exchange fell sharply. In
               particular, the distribution of the daily trading volume becomes
               less skewed (fewer big trades) and had smaller kurtosis on days
               following DDoS attacks. The results are robust to alternative
               specifications, as well as to restricting the data to activity
               prior to March 2013, i.e., the period before the first large
               appreciation in the price of and attention paid to Bitcoin.",
